This directory should contain DSA private keys as used by the Handle System
client library. The key files must have specific names. For example, the
key file containing the private key of the public key in handle value
300:0.NA/10916 (ie. the handle value with index 300 in handle 0.NA/10916)
must be called "300_0_NA_10916".
