This directory should contain DSA private keys as used by the Handle System
client library. The key files must have specific names. For example, the
key file containing the private key of the public key in handle value
300:0.NA/10916 (ie. the handle value with index 300 in handle 0.NA/10916)
must be called "300_0_NA_10916".


The users.rb allows for 2 methods of authorization:
- public key
- secret key
Public key authentication requires two keys: a public key and a private key.
The public key is stored in a handle to make it available to the public. The
private key should be securely stored on the computer with the handle client
that will be authenticated. To prevent unauthorized use of a private key, it
can be encrypted using a symmetric algorithm. 
Secret key authentication relies on a secure hashing algorithm, chosen by the
client being authenticated. Currently, this algorithm can be either MD5 or SHA1.
A secret key consists of a single byte string of size ranging from 0 to
2147483648. This byte string is stored as plain text in a handle. It is highly
advisable to restrict read permissions on the handle to ensure the secrecy of
the secret key

The default method of authorization is public key without encryption. You can
use a encrypted private key. The passphrase should than be stored in the
parameter "keycipher"
The second method of authorization can be enabled by using the parameter
"secret" in the users.rb file.

it is not possible to use both "keycipher" and "secret". They are mutually
exclusive.


The "institute" parameter in users.rb is only used in the "gwdgpid" profile in
config.rb. This allows for the same prefix to be used amongst many institutes.
Only if the profile "gwdgpid" has been set this parameters has to be filled in.
